# Overview

This is a basic Python educational project that demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts. The repository contains a single Python script that showcases basic functions, variable assignments, string formatting, and simple arithmetic operations. It appears to be designed as a learning tool or starting template for Python beginners.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Core Design Pattern
- **Single-file script architecture**: The entire application is contained within one Python file (`hello.py`)
- **Function-based organization**: Code is organized into small, focused functions with clear responsibilities
- **Educational structure**: Functions are well-documented with docstrings following Python conventions

## Code Organization
- **Modular functions**: Each function handles a specific task (greeting, calculation)
- **Main function pattern**: Uses a `main()` function to orchestrate the program flow
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Greeting logic, arithmetic operations, and program execution are separated

## Error Handling
- **Basic parameter defaults**: Functions include default parameters to handle missing inputs
- **Type flexibility**: Arithmetic functions accept both integers and floats

## Documentation Strategy
- **Comprehensive docstrings**: All functions include detailed documentation with parameter and return value descriptions
- **Inline comments**: Code includes explanatory comments for clarity

# External Dependencies

## Runtime Dependencies
- **Python 3**: Requires Python 3.x (indicated by shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python3`)
- **Standard library only**: No external packages or libraries required

## Development Dependencies
- None specified - uses only Python built-in functionality

## Database/Storage
- None - purely computational script with no data persistence

## APIs/External Services
- None - self-contained script with no external integrations
